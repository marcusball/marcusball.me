    <p>Hello, I'm Marcus Ball.</p>
    <p>
      I'm an engineer at heart. I love to make things work, and to make them work well.
      My passion is writing clean, elegant, well-designed code to create high-quality
      software inside and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated the Univeristy of Florida in 2016 with a degree in computer science,
      a minor in entomology—I'm good a finding bugs—and an "interdisciplinary focus" in
      social psychology.
